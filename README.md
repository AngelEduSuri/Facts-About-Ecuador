# Facts About Ecuador App

A simple app with 30 interesting facts about Ecuador. It's a project to practice Jetpack Compose Animation and how to create a lazy list animated when its items are loaded vertically and how they enter from left or right alternately with a `spring effect`. Also, when an item is clicked, it will show more information about the facts with an `expanded effect` on the text.
